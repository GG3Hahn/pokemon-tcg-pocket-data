# Pokémon TCG Pocket Data

This repository contains data about _Pokémon TCG Pocket_'s cards in the same (JSON-based) format used in [PokemonTCG.io's data for the main TCG](https://github.com/PokemonTCG/pokemon-tcg-data).

# To Do

* Add flavortexts
* Stop hotlinking Limitless for images
* Add set metadata
* Add theme deck lists

# Thanks

A big thanks goes Robin Schulz and his website (Limitless)[https://limitlesstcg.com]. Most of this data has been scraped from there.
